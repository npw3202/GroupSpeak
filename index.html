<p>For any hearing person, hearing others in a conservation is easy. This task is difficult for deaf people. Some rely on
access services like interpreting but a interpreter can't follow a deaf person all day. Some rely on lip reading, but it is not
always accurate. Other ways are writing down what the group is saying or texting to each other. However, since oral communcation is the
preferred method of almost all hearing individuals, paper or using the phone is not the most efficient way to get the message across.
<p>

<br>

	<br>
	-Tell all phones the deaf user id number.<br>
	<br>
	-Leave the phones near their respective owners.<br>
	<br>
	-As the conservation begins, the deaf user will read the conservation on their phone.<br> 
	<br>
